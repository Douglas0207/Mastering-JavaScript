# Mastering-JavaScript
Going to Master Javascript before 1st of April!


Its 4th of March , I have Prepared a Schedule to complete JavaScript in 28 days. In this readme File . I'm going to update it after Completing the particular schedule for each day. 

### 📌 My Learning Timeline  
🟢 **March 4** → Completed some Basics of Javascript.

🟢 **March 5** → learnt about Operators and User Input.

🟢 **March 6** → learnt about Control Flow - if-else, switch, ternary operators.

🟢 **March 7** → learnt about Loops - For, While, Do-While

🟢 **March 9** → learnt about function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.

🟢 **March 10** → learnt about arrays, 2D arrays, and array methods.

🟢 **March 11** → learnt about JavaScript Objects, Methods, this keyword.
Designed a calculator using html , Tailwind Css and Dark mode using JavaScript.

🟢 **March 12** → learnt about constructor functions, classes, inheritance.

🟢 **March 13** → I have found myself struggling to get a hang on HTML and CSS concepts , so I have prepared a Cheat Sheet (HandWritten Notes), making it easier for me to know all the attributes we can use in html and css

🟢 **March 15** → learnt about ES6 Features - spread operator, rest parameters, destructuring.

🟢 **March 16** → learnt about DOM Manipulation - querySelector, getElementById, classList.

🟢 **March 17** → learnt about Event Handling & Local Storage.

🟢 **March 18** → learnt about Event listeners click, keydown, input and Worked with local storage.

🟢 **March 19** → learnt about Async JavaScript, Fetch API, and Promises.

🟢 **March 21** → learnt about Asynchronous JavaScript & Callbacks

🟢 **March 22** → learnt about Promises, .then(), .catch(), async/await.

🟢 **March 23** → learnt about fetching data from APIs.

🟢 **March 24** → Did a Small Project on getting pokemon Sprite images from an Api. I have uploaded my project on git hub Pages.

🟢 **March 25** → Working on another project which fetches data from API.

🟢 **March 27** → Designed a Student Login Portal from figma.
